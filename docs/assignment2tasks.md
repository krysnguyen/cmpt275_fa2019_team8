# Assignment 2 - Tasks 

| Task | Description | Assignee | Completed |
| :----- | :----- | :-----: | :-----: | 
| Requirements document - Introduction | Explain what the system does and what is it useful for. You may be
able to borrow text from your Project planning document | Kevin Jerome | |
| Requirements document - Intended Audience List | The kinds of users for this system in some detail (certainly
more detail than in the Project planning document from the previous assignment).
Make clear what experience, expertise, and goals you assume they have. | Kevin Jerome | |
| Requirements document - Features/Functional Requirements | Catalog every significant feature of the
system. This should be an exhaustive list. Hint: Give each of these features its own
anchor or page, so that in the design document (described below) you can easily link
to them | Kevin Jerome | |
| Requirements document - Non-functional requirements | Describe your system's non-functional requirements. | Kevin Jerome | |
| Requirements document - Example Tutorials | Provide 3 - 5 (or more, if necessary) examples of typical usage
scenarios. These need to be highly detailed, step-by-step tutorial-like descriptions of
how to use your system's major features. You should include screenshots of how
your system will behave (users do not want to read a lot of text!). | Kevin Jerome | |
| Requirements document - Glossary | List all technical terms and their precise definitions here. These will be
terms about your application, not about programming or software engineering. For
example, in a grade-keeper application, terms like "course", "grade", "mark", and
"GPA" all need precise definitions | Kevin Jerome | |
| Design document - Guidelines | List all technical guidelines (e.g. "Development will be done using the
Eclipse IDE, version XX"), and any relevant ethical or legal issues. | | |
| Design document - System Diagrams | This should include 2 or 3 (or more, if needed) substantial
diagrams showing how the major modules, classes, and functions of your system
relate and share data. Important: these must be diagrams as described in our (System
models) textbook; you must follow the proper rules and notations for the diagrams
you use. It is not acceptable to make up your own kind of diagram! If you are using
an object-oriented programming language, than one of your diagrams ought to be a
class diagram. | | |
| Design document - Data Requirements | This is a summary of all the I/O for your system, including
exact definitions of file and database formats, what other systems (if any) yours
interacts with, and how the user interacts with the system via the
mouse/keyboard/wii-mote/etc. If you are using a database, please include a database
schema. | | |
| Design document - Feature Priority | You will be going through three implementation iterations during
the course of this project --- version 1, version 2, and version 3. Label each feature
listed in your user manual, as being delivered in version 1, 2, or 3. Hint: An ordered
list of hyperlinks to the relevant features in the user manual might be a good way to
organize this | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Software testings tools| The software tool(s) you are using to perform automatic unit testing, and any other
kinds of software testing. Do a survey to find out what tools are available. Tell us
how you generate and manage your test cases | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Deadlines | The internal deadlines your group sets for unit/system testing of the code for release.
Naturally, these deadlines must be well enough before the project submission date to
give you time to do the testing and fix errors that might arise, but also late enough so
that the development group has time to get all the features implemented. | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Deliverable dates | Give the time, date, and location for when user acceptance testing of version 3 of
your project (the final version) will be done. If you also want to do user testing for
one or both of the earlier versions, then include the time, date, and location for those
tests as well. | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Integration | Detail what kind of integration testing you expect to do, and how you expect to do it.
It's wise to avoid "big bang" integration, where all the models are combined and
tested at once. Instead, tell us how you plan to incrementally integrate and test the
system. Be clear about how this testing differs from the unit testing you are also
doing | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Project Sizing | The software tool(s) you are using to measure the size and complexity of your
project. You should be automatically counting various software metrics such as
number of files, number of lines of codes, number of classes, etc.
In addition to providing the raw measurement values, graph this measurement data
(e.g. as line-graphs using an Excel spreadsheet) for each version of your project.
Clearly label your data and graphs so that someone unfamiliar with the details of
your project can understand what it is about without having to look at anything other
than the graph itself | | |
| Quality assurance plan - Other items | List everything else you are doing to ensure the quality of your project. Give specific
times and dates whenever possible. | | |
